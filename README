This is a windows sample for creating a two shard server.

Open a powershell window and run:

To set up and configure:

	createDataFolders.ps1			- This creates the data folders for all the mongo instances
	configure.ps1					- This configures the two replica sets and creates a sharded server.

To run (once setup and configured):
	runAll.bat

Configuration:
==============

shard-a (This is a replica set) - Has 2 dabase instances and an arbiter.

	port 30000		Database
	port 30001		Database
	port 30002		Arbiter

shard-b (This is a replica set) - Has 2 dabase instances and an arbiter.

	port 30100		Database
	port 30101		Database
	port 30102		Arbiter
	
Config Servers:
	port 27019
	port 27020
	port 27012

MongoS:
	port 40000
	
	
Usage:
======

Connect to the MongoS as you would connect to MongoDB normally on Port 40000.

To create a sharded collection:
===============================

Connect the mongoDb shell to the MongoS and run the following commands:

use Test_System_CustomersShared;
sh.enableSharding('Test_System_CustomersShared')
db.routeResult.createIndex({customerId: 1, assetId:1});
sh.shardCollection('Test_System_CustomersShared.routeResult', {customerId: 1, assetId:1})

Usefull Commands:

sh.status()
	Displays the sharded database and collections. It also shows the chunking rules / configuration..
	
rs.status()
	When connected to a member of a replica set, this shows the status of all the members. e.g. Primary, Secondary and Arbiter (other status are available).
